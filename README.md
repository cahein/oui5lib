OpenUI5 library
===============

The oui5lib project aims to provide tools to simplify and speed up development with OpenUI5. It is partly just a collection of useful functions but also provides extensions to handle requests, validate input and construct form controls.

The project uses grunt for various project related tasks:

Generate documentation with
    
    grunt gendoc

Generate a minified JavaScript file to include in your project

    grunt generate-dist

To prepare the examples run

    grunt prepare-examples

For tests, please use the SpecRunner.html files in the webapp/test and examples/domainObjects/test folders.
